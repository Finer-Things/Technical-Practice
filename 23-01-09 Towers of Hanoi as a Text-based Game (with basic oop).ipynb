    "**The Problem**: The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given a stacked tower on the first wooden peg with n disks, how do we move all of the disks to the last wooden peg?"

    "**Background**: The first time I saw this problem was while reading a number theory book as an undergrad in 2011. As I worked through a couple examples, I saw that the strategy for the tower moving process could be used for the same problem with n-1 disks, only you needed to switch the second two pegs in your mind before performing that strategy. That worked very well! It also told you that the number of moves more than doubled each time, since you had to load up the disks before the bottom one, then move the bottom disk, and then move them all back. If it takes k moves for the n-1 pile of disks, you would need k moves, then 1 more for the bottom disk, and then k more after that. This totals 2k+1. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am happy to be writing this program, because normally when one describes an indictive process it is normally followed by refraining from using the answer (because the computations get tedious quickly). But having a computer that is billions of times faster allows for many computations requiring no effort if you can program them to implement your strategy! "
